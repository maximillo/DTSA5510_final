DTSA5509 Final â€“ Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning Final Project

Having gone through the week 4 BBC news prediction, I found that news prediction is a very interesting topic that involves highly relavent ML techniques we learned in the class, and NLP that we have not learned in the class. Therefore, I decided to continue on the same topic of new prediction in this final project by using a different dataset, the AG News Classification Dataset dataset (Click here to access the AG News Classification Dataset on Kaggle), to practice Unsupervised ML. This dataset contains 120,000 training samples. It's a much larger set of training samples than what we used in the week 4 BBC news practice. The Detailed description of the dataset will be included in the the following EDA section.

I will perform EDA, including data cleaning, feature extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for news topic prediction using four different algorithms, among them the NMF is an unsupervised ML we have learned in the class

NMF
SVM
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Upon the modeling, I will compare the performance of these algorithms by the accuracy scores from the best performing model generated by GridSearch.
